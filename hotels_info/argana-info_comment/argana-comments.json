I loved the few activities they had for kids even though it wasn't much. My kids had fun playing with the \"Arganas\" as they called them. I even got a few moments of peace to have a glass of wine. I also loved, loved the layout of the sitting areas by the pool area. The hotel wasn't very busy so it was empty (which was a shame) but the large sitting areas in the back were like a magical kingdom just for my kids and I to explore. It would be the perfect place for a party. Our room had a super nice TV with the ability to connect to Wifi and Netflix so that was fun.

God location the beach is about 10mins away back of the hotel and mcdonalds, pizza hut clubs across the road and few good cafes-restaurants i recommend brooklyn burger very yummy burgers and staff were friendly. One thing i didnt like is how busy the roads were no1 stopped for anyone esp having to push prams they ignore red lights. Wifi in lobby and in rooms it kept dropping. Swimming pool was nice and clean. Buffet breakfast simple and ok. Overall simple hotel good staff would go back if on own not with kids as theres nothing for children.", "score": "6.2"}, {"name": "Edwina", "nationality": "United Kingdom", "number_of_nights": "6 nights \u00b7  June 2019", "clinet_type": "Group", "room_type": "Double or Twin Room with Sea View", "review_date": "Reviewed: June 23, 2019", "visite_date": "June 2019", "text": "The staff were awesome especially....Ilham, Yacine, Bob and the restaurant staff, reception.

Confortable \u00e7a c'est le job des gouvernantes et de leurs femmes d'ouvrages. Moi j'ai eu la chance comme \u00e0 mon habitude dans ce 3eme \u00e9tage d'h\u00e9riter d'une gouvernante IJJA et de Nassima qui sont tr\u00e8s gentilles et tr\u00e8s professionnelles. Je suis bord\u00e9lique de nature mais quand je reviens dans ma chambre tout est au bon endroit , propre et m\u00e9ticuleusement bien rang\u00e9. Merci \u00e0 elles. Mais venir \u00e0 Argana, et ne pas passer au SPA est un sacril\u00e8ge. Il faut absolument y faire un tour pour savourer un bon Hammam des mains de Na\u00efma et de tr\u00e8s bons soins des mains de Nabilla et tout \u00e7a sous la houlette de la professionnelle Siham responsable des lieux. Pour la restauration, je ne prends dans mes r\u00e9servations que le petit d\u00e9j et j'en suis tr\u00e8s satisfait car je ne mange que marocain traditionnel Harcha et Msmen des mains de Le\u00efla et d'Oumaima et des autres. J'aurais bien aim\u00e9 prendre ce petit d\u00e9j dans la Kheima que je trouve mal exploit\u00e9e pour le moment. J'esp\u00e8re qu'il y aura du nouveau de ce c\u00f4t\u00e9 l\u00e0.", "score": "10"}, {"name": "Serge", "nationality": "France", "number_of_nights": "6 nights \u00b7  October 2021", "clinet_type": "Couple", "room_type": "Standard Double Room", "review_date": "Reviewed: October 15, 2021", "visite_date": "October 2021", "text": "seulement le prix", "score": "3.0"}, {"name": "Abdellah", "nationality": "Morocco", "number_of_nights": "1 night \u00b7  October 2021", "clinet_type": "Couple", "room_type": "Standard Double Room", "review_date": "Reviewed: October 15, 2021", "visite_date": "October 2021", "text": "La piscine est bien.", "score": "1.0"}, {"name": "Ismahene", "nationality": "Spain", "number_of_nights": "2 nights \u00b7  October 2021", "clinet_type": "Family", "room_type": "Double or Twin Room with Sea View", "review_date": "Reviewed: October 15, 2021", "visite_date": "October 2021", "text": "Pas d\u2019accueil, chambre non faite ( oublier) Buffet pas bon et pas bcp de choix, \u00e0 \u00e9viter", "score": "3.0"}, {"name": "Anouar", "nationality": "Netherlands", "number_of_nights": "1 night \u00b7  October 2021", "clinet_type": "Group", "room_type": "Standard Double Room", "review_date": "Reviewed: October 15, 2021", "visite_date": "October 2021", "text": "Kamers waren te oud", "score": "4.0"}, {"name": "Abdejalil", "nationality": "France", "number_of_nights": "3 nights \u00b7  October 2021", "clinet_type": "Family", "room_type": "Double or Twin Room with Sea View", "review_date": "Reviewed: October 15, 2021", "visite_date": "October 2021", "text": "Pas grand chose", "score": "5.0"}, {"name": "Chaimae", "nationality": "Morocco", "number_of_nights": "1 night \u00b7  October 2021", "clinet_type": "Solo traveler", "room_type": "Standard Double Room", "review_date": "Reviewed: October 14, 2021", "visite_date": "October 2021", "text": "C'est pas la chambre qui j'ai choisi sur booking", "score": "1.0"}, {"name": "Laayoune", "nationality": "Morocco", "number_of_nights": "3 nights \u00b7  October 2021", "clinet_type": "Family", "room_type": "Standard Double Room", "review_date": "Reviewed: October 14, 2021", "visite_date": "October 2021", "text": "Toooooppp", "score": "10"}, {"name": "Morad", "nationality": "Belgium", "number_of_nights": "2 nights \u00b7  October 2021", "clinet_type": "Solo traveler", "room_type": "Standard Double Room", "review_date": "Reviewed: October 13, 2021", "visite_date": "October 2021", "text": "Impossible de dormir music tr\u00e8s forte qui vient d\u2019un club o\u00f9 je sait trop quoi!!

Petite remarque : les miroirs pivotants des SDB ont \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9s. Les draps ont \u00e9t\u00e9 chang\u00e9s r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement pendant notre s\u00e9jour sans demande particuli\u00e8re de notre part. Les transats de la piscine ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9s et font l\u2019objet d\u2019un nettoyage r\u00e9gulier. En bref Ils n\u2019attendent pas que le mat\u00e9riel soit d\u00e9grad\u00e9 pour intervenir. Je vais reprendre maintenant ce que j\u2019indique depuis des ann\u00e9es : L\u2019accueil est chaleureux, de la part du personnel de l\u2019h\u00f4tel ( accueil, restaurant, femme de chambre, spa, gardien, ou piscine) et cela pour tous les clients, qu\u2019ils soient nouveaux ou anciens. Le personnel est toujours disponible \u00e0 n\u2019importe quelle heure de la journ\u00e9e, du soir ou de la nuit et s\u2019emploie \u00e0 satisfaire le moindre de nos d\u00e9sirs. La restauration est au top : menu vari\u00e9, copieux et exotique. Le spa propose des soins vari\u00e9s et \u00e0 des prix raisonnables avec une gentillesse respectueuse et discr\u00e8te. Les \u00ab agents de Spa \u00bb se r\u00e9v\u00e8lent tr\u00e8s professionnels. La propret\u00e9 des locaux est \u00e0 souligner : les femmes de m\u00e9nage s\u2019emploient toute la journ\u00e9e, \u00e0 rendre les lieux \u00e9clatants. La vue des chambres donnent sur la mer situ\u00e9e \u00e0 5 minutes, \u00e0 peine, \u00e0 pied ( et je ne suis pas un grand marcheur vu mon \u00e2ge). L\u2019h\u00f4tel est situ\u00e9 dans un endroit pris\u00e9 , \u00e0 5 mn en taxi du centre, des lieux de fr\u00e9quentations touristiques anim\u00e9es ( moins de 20 dirhams) . je conseille cet h\u00f4tel", "score": "10"}, {"name": "Said", "nationality": "Morocco", "number_of_nights": "1 night \u00b7  August 2020", "clinet_type": "Group", "room_type": "Standard Double Room", "review_date": "Reviewed: August 12, 2020", "visite_date": "August 2020", "text": "Hotel a taille humaine personnel tr\u00e8s sympathique Tr\u00e8s propre piscine un peu fra\u00eeche espace Transat et d\u00e9tente tr\u00e8s sympa Petit-d\u00e9jeuner topissime avec des jus frais diff\u00e9rents chaque jour Cr\u00eapes marocaine Buffet varie crudit\u00e9 excellente avec sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9 marocaine Menus continentaux et marocains en alternance pareil pour les desserts Bref hotel de charme a 10 min de la plage un peu loin du centre ms taxis qui fourmillent les oranges par maximum 3 personnes les blancs pour plus .", "score": "10"}, {"name": "Amina", "nationality": "Morocco", "number_of_nights": "1 night \u00b7  August 2020", "clinet_type": "Group", "room_type": "Standard Double Room", "review_date": "Reviewed: August 12, 2020", "visite_date": "August 2020", "text": "Nous avons s\u00e9journer 1 semaine cela c'est tr\u00e8s bien pass\u00e9 le personnel est \u00e0 votre \u00e9coute le petit d\u00e9jeuner est tr\u00e8s bien un buffet au large choix la piscine est formidable la plage n'est pas tr\u00e8s loin seul b\u00e9mol faut \u00eatre v\u00e9hicule aussi non taxis je vous conseil l'h\u00f4tel car pas tr\u00e8s grand par rapport au autres donc plus \u00e0 votre \u00e9coute", "score": "10"}, {"name": "Xsafin", "nationality": "Italy", "number_of_nights": "5 nights \u00b7  August 2020", "clinet_type": "Solo traveler", "room_type": "Superior Double Room", "review_date": "Reviewed: August 12, 2020", "visite_date": "August 2020", "text": "Bella e molto accogliente personale molto educato e di bella presenza grazie a mariam ragazza magica che ti risolve tutti problemi e al personale della sicurezza che sempre disponibile ...", "score": "10"}, {"name": "Latifa", "nationality": "Morocco", "number_of_nights": "1 night \u00b7  August 2020", "clinet_type": "Group", "room_type": "Standard Double Room", "review_date": "Reviewed: August 12, 2020", "visite_date": "August 2020", "text": "Hotel tr\u00e8s propre personnel sympa les r\u00e9ceptionniste chaleureux le restaurant varier le petit d\u00e9jeuner riche je recommande de revenir ce moi de janvier pour passer quelques jours avec mon amie vraiment c'\u00e9tait superbe", "score": "10"}, {"name": "Bouchra", "nationality": "Morocco", "number_of_nights": "1 night \u00b7  August 2020", "clinet_type": "Couple", "room_type": "Standard Double Room", "review_date": "Reviewed: August 12, 2020", "visite_date": "August 2020", "text": "l emplacement. l hotel et pres de la plage et du centre", "score": "3.0"}, {"name": "Tamimi", "nationality": "France", "number_of_nights": "14 nights \u00b7  August 2020", "clinet_type": "Couple", "room_type": "Standard Double Room", "review_date": "Reviewed: August 12, 2020", "visite_date": "August 2020", "text": "J'ai pass\u00e9 14 jours avec mon \u00e9pouse et on a \u00e9t\u00e9 agr\u00e9ablement surpris par le rapport qualit\u00e9/prix.
