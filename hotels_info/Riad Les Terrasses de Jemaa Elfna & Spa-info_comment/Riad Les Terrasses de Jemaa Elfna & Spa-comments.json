We were on our honeymoon and the hostess welcomed us with some rose petals on our bed, which was so thoughtful :) we stayed only one night, but we could use the jacuzzi, enjoy a massage and have dinner in oriental style (which we all booked pretty last minute). The rooms are beautifully decorated in Arabian themes, we stayed in the red Algerian room. Big plus: huge tv with Netflix in the rooms. We loved our stay here! Free parking on the street.
