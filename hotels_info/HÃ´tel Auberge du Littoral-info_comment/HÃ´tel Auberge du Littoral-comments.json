It\u2019s the real Morocco and I loved how so kind everyone was. The swimming pool is small but water is warm and clean and never busy.Food in the restaurant is lovely and really reasonable compared to the surrounding areas. They have the best mint tea I had for 10 dirhams. Walking distance to the beach. There is the devils rock close by but didn\u2019t have time to go there.The local market had lovely fresh bread which we\u2019d buy every day. We also tried the fish in the stalls- a whole plate of freshly fried fish with lemon wedges and chilli peppers and a loaf of fresh bread- only 20 Dirhams- less than 2 sterling and enough for both of us. Bought my tagine pottery from the local market beautiful. The staff were all so very welcoming. We would definitely come again.", "score": "8.3"}, {"name": "Miranda", "nationality": "Netherlands", "number_of_nights": "1 night \u00b7  June 2019", "clinet_type": "Couple", "room_type": "Standard Double or Twin Room", "review_date": "Reviewed: June 9, 2019", "visite_date": "June 2019", "text": "Nice pool, friendly staff, fine breakfast.
