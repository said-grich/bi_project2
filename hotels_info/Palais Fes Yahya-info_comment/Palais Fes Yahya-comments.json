The grounds are beautiful, our kids enjoyed the roaming peacocks and being able to pick fresh cherries off the tree across from our room. We stayed in one of the apartments and it was very spacious and clean for our family of four. The staff was always very friendly and the breakfast was very good! There is both indoor and outdoor swimming pool available, although we did not have time to use them, they looked nice. This property is European style, which was a nice break from all of the Moroccan style properties we had been staying in on our journey through Morocco. The cedar forest and monkeys are very close by. Would not hesitate to return and stay here again!", "score": "10"}, {"name": "Iris", "nationality": "Israel", "number_of_nights": "1 night \u00b7  November 2021", "clinet_type": "Family", "room_type": "Superior Double Room with Terrace", "review_date": "Reviewed: December 29, 2021", "visite_date": "November 2021", "text": "The rooms are nice with very nice view.

Tastefully decorated like an English manor with local the famous Atlas Cedar wood & art craft. The food dining experience was absolutely delightful. The full course dinner menu was heavenly tasty. The apple pie was better than most gourmet pastry sold by landmarks like Le Notre, Chez Paul, etc. So was the home made croissants served in the fabulous breakfast. This is a great getaway for Canadian expats like me who miss the Eastern Townships and it\u2019s beautiful country Inns. I would go back in winter when the snow is all over Azrou & Ifrane to try the Berber Spa. Kudos to the Master Chef & to the local staff.
