The rooms have all sea views due to the round construction and on the balcony you can watch sunrise and sunset over the sea. The beach is only a few minutes walk away. There you can rent beach chairs with umbrellas. M'Diq is about 10 minutes away by car but there is often too much traffic (then the drive takes about 20 minutes). There we were always in the evening: here you can eat well. The breakfast in the Lydia Resort is expandable.... Otherwise: Wonderful beach, comfortable bed, very clean hotel, extremely friendly and helpful staff, ypu should bring a car to reach M'diq faster", "score": "9.2"}, {"name": "Mansoor", "nationality": "United Arab Emirates", "number_of_nights": "1 night \u00b7  January 2019", "clinet_type": "Group", "room_type": "Standard Double Room", "review_date": "Reviewed: January 17, 2019", "visite_date": "January 2019", "text": "The staff were welcoming and helpful", "score": "10"}]
