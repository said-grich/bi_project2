However, everything else was so perfect, it didn't seem to be a big deal. Everywhere in the hotel is absolutely spotless and well presented and the staff are without exception excellent. My Mum was made to feel special at every opportunity as we were celebrating her 70th birthday. Breakfast was perfect and our evening meal in the Savoy Grill was just fantastic. The chateaubriand was perfection and as with all areas of the hotel, the level was service was exceptional. The Beaufort bar is a really relaxing venue with attentive service and we enjoyed drinks in here both before and after our meal. The residents lounge was the perfect place to grab a quick drink whilst waiting for our lunch and was a welcome quieter area. As we were arriving, the Christmas decorations were being installed...it really is absolutely beautiful and made the lobby area in particular feel very special. If you are considering staying here, I urge you to do it. It is worth every penny. I would stay here again in a heart beat.",

The hotel was in the perfect location for exploring Covent Garden and the West End and we were in walking distance to the theatre where we had booked a show. We had drinks in the Beaufort Bar where the ambience was welcoming, cosy with a vibrant buzz and the staff's recommendations were always spot on to what we asked for. Dinner in Gordon Ramsay's restaurant was outstanding with the staff, again, friendly and attentive and open to hearing about our experience. Our meal was exceptional and we couldn't fault any of it. This was a special treat but has given me cherished memories. Oh and they also brought up to our room a special birthday treat for my Mum which was a special touch.",

Dinner in Gordon\u2019s grill was lovely unlike the service which really let us down. Waited ages for our table to be ready that had been previously booked weeks beforehand to then be shown our table to then wait ages for a drink. We paid a fortune for a bottle of wine to pour it ourselves. Felt very neglected especially the prices that we paid. We found out the next day Mr Ramsay was actually filming upstairs so they were extremely busy. We still deserved better as it was a special treat for hubster.

    "text": "What a fantastic place to stay, the whole experience was amazing from arriving to leaving. On arrival we were asked to a private room to check-in which made you feel special, the decoration and facilities were fantastic. Our room wasn't ready when we arrived so they put us in the bar and gave us complimentary cocktails, we had to leave after 4 because they just kept bringing them which was great but we were feeling tipsy, it turned out that the only reason our room wasn't ready was because they were blowing up balloons and decorating the room for my birthday they also gave me a cake and a card from everyone at the hotel. Our coffee machine was leaking so I contacted reception who sent someone straight away to fix but then sent complimentary coffee, Cake and biscuits on a fabulous fancy tray it was amazing. I have stayed at many hotels around the world and this one was at the top of the list for rating...... Thank you to everyone for making my stay the best I had a fantastic weekend celebrating my birthday.",

We were greeted by two doorman who were lovely and took care of us and our bags. During check-in we were looked after by a lovely receptionist. We can't recall her name, however she had long dark hair and was so nice and put us at ease straight away. She talked about us celebrating Mum's birthday and didn't rush us at all. Once we had our room key, Robert accompanied us to floor 6 because I don't like lifts! Robert was reassuring and very kind. The room was a complimentary upgrade and exceeded my expectations. It was big, with a mini hall, large bedroom and a huge bathroom which sparkled. On the table there was a gift tied in a Savoy bow for my Mum's birthday- a leather bound notebook and chocolate bar. This is typical of what we experienced; all these small details and touches made a huge difference. We then had a knock at the door and The Savoy had prepared a birthday chocolate cake! Thank you for the gifts, this was so generous. After we had unpacked, we spent some time in the pool. We were relaxing in a pool in a serene environment, with the hustle and bustle of central London surrounding us, but we were completely chilled out. We had dinner at the Savoy Grill which was excellent. Still full from our dinner, we enjoyed a splendid breakfast overlooking The Thames in Kaspers. Our waiter was attentive, polite and couldn't do enough. Again, this is typical of the service at The Savoy- the people literally cannot do enough for you and it is world class. In the evening we returned to collect our bags and the receptionist who checked us in hugged and kissed us goodbye. She remembered us from the day before and chatted away, making us feel very valued. Thank you, we will return :)",
