I felt welcomed by all the staff members. The rooms are spacious and very well equiped. It's really calm and comfy. There was a variety of food servings for the breakfast. The pool is really nice and very calm. It's the perfect place to relax and cool down in those hot summer days. PS : I stayed in the hotel before and so many positive changes were made. I am really glad I came back and did not stay on an okey note as the hotel exceeded my expectations this time around. As for all party animals, there is an amazing night club with direct access from the hotel.", "score": "10"}, {"name": "Mohammed", "nationality": "United Kingdom", "number_of_nights": "13 nights \u00b7  August 2021", "clinet_type": "Family", "room_type": "Double Room - Pool Side", "review_date": "Reviewed: August 22, 2021", "visite_date": "August 2021", "text": "Garden, pool, breakfast", "score": "7.0"}, {"name": "Yalaoui", "nationality": "France", "number_of_nights": "1 night \u00b7  July 2021", "clinet_type": "Group", "room_type": "Double Room city side", "review_date": "Reviewed: July 30, 2021", "visite_date": "July 2021", "text": "Rooms are old decorated, need a refresh", "score": "7.0"}, {"name": "Ilyas", "nationality": "Morocco", "number_of_nights": "3 nights \u00b7  July 2021", "clinet_type": "Couple", "room_type": "Double Room city side", "review_date": "Reviewed: July 12, 2021", "visite_date": "July 2021", "text": "Pool, restaurants and especially Fan Zone.", "score": "8.0"}, {"name": "Nabila", "nationality": "Morocco", "number_of_nights": "3 nights \u00b7  April 2021", "clinet_type": "Family", "room_type": "Double Room city side", "review_date": "Reviewed: April 25, 2021", "visite_date": "April 2021", "text": "The staff is very professional and customer oriented.
