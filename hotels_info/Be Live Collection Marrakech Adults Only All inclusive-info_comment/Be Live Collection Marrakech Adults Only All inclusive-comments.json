Everything was very nice, the staff, food and the ambiance. The staff is very kind and helps you when you need help. For example, in the hotel you can find a taxi service to the airport. You can book a corona test or you can book excursions in the hotel. There is also a shuttlebus to the medina. It is also a very clean hotel and the rooms are big enough! The staff works hard, so you get your drinks on time and the tables are cleared very quickly after dinner. They also do their best to provide fun entertainment in the evenings. I definitely recommend this hotel for anyone who wants to relax for a while.

The staff was really friendly and the hotel didn't feel crowded at all, which was also very pleasant.
